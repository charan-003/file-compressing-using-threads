# file-compressing-using-threads
This project implements a multithreaded file compression tool using C++ with OpenMP and zlib. It reads files in chunks, compresses them in parallel using threads, and writes the compressed data to an output file in gzip format. The program demonstrates the use of OpenMP for parallelization and ensures thread-safe file operations using mutexes.
